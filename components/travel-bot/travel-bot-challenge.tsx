        Create a Chatbot with the theme of your choice and in the program/software of your choice.
        We are looking for someone capable of taking on challenges and making them a reality. 
        We want a person who understands how a chatbot can work and all it can do.
        </p>
        <p className='leading-relaxed'>
        You must have your chatbot on a public link so we can test it. 
        You can create a folder on Drive or send it to us via Dropbox.
        </p>
        <p className='leading-relaxed'>We will evaluate:</p>
        <ul  className='list-disc list-inside leading-relaxed'>

            <li>User Experience (easy to understand)</li>
            <li>Spelling and Writing</li>
        </ul>
        <p className='leading-relaxed'>Bonus points:</p>
        <p className='leading-relaxed'>Earn extra points by mentioning what data we can extract from this bot, e.g., 
            number of users who completed the conversation, number of users who answered X question.</p>
