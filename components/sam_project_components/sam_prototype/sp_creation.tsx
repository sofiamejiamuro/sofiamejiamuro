        <p className='leading-relaxed text-justify sm:text-xl'>
            In developing SAM, we focused on key elements for effectiveness. 
            Detailed system prompts, clear response formats, and data retrieval functions ensured accurate, engaging communication. 
            User interaction guidelines and filtering maintained a safe, user-friendly environment. 
            It is important to mention that achieving the final versions involved significant iteration on the system prompts, as no guides existed before. 
            This approach resulted in a robust assistant that enhanced user engagement and support for the company.
